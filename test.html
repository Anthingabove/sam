    <h1>How To Use This Virtual Machine</h1>
    <p>Warning! You cannot install software or run executables. The file system works, however you cannot really "manage" the files. You can browse and open firefox using a tricky way. To open firefox, first download a file then click on it firefox will open! A simple exploit lol.</p>
